    "I have used JLCPCB to manufacture blank boards before, but this board is my first attempt to design a board that will be (mostly) populated by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).\n",

    "JLCPCB have a set of \"Basic Parts\", and access to LCSC parts that are \"Extended Parts\".\n",
    "Extended parts have a $3 additional charge for each different component.\n",
    "This covers their costs of having to load up the pick'n'place machine with the new components.\n",
    "Additionally, they may have a larger order quantity that you do when using LCSC parts.\n",

    "Namely the ESP32 requires you to use Standard fabrication.\n",
    "In my case for 5 Controller boards this doubles the price.\n",

    "#### Standard Fabrication\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard fabrication has a few more requirements in the board design\n",
    "The PCB must have 5mm rails without components and fiducials within this area.  \n",
